# Building a resilient IaaS architecture hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a pre-configured IaaS environment and then redesign and update it to account for resiliency and in general high availability. Throughout the hands-on lab you will use various configuration options and services to help build a resilient architecture. 

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and use the following services:


-   The use of availability sets

-   The use of Managed Disks

-   Design principles when provisioning storage to VMs

-   Effective employment of Azure Backup to provide point-in-time recovery

-   SQL Server Always On Availability Groups 


## Overview

Contoso has asked you to deploy their infrastructure in a resilient manner to insure their infrastructure will be available for their users and gain an SLA from Microsoft.

## Solution architecture

Highly resilient deployment of Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure.

5.  Once the logged in, click on **File and Storage Services** in **Server Manager**

    ![In Server Manager, File and Storage services is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image55.png "Server Manager ")

6.  Click on **Disks**, and let the data load. You should now see an **Unknown** partition disk in the list.

    ![In the Disks section, under DC01, the Unknown partition disk is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image56.png "Disks section")

7.  Right-click on this disk and choose **New Volume...** from the context menu options

    ![The Right-click menu for the Unknown partition disk, New Volume is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image57.png "Right-click menu")

8.  Follow the prompts in the **New Volume Wizard** to format this disk, as the **F:\\** drive for the domain controller

9.  Perform these same steps for the remaining 3 DCs (**DC02**, **DC03**, and **DC04**)

10. Go back to the Azure portal dashboard and click on **DC01**. Next, click on **Networking** followed by the name of the NIC.

    ![Under Settings, Networking is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image58.png "Settings section")

    ![Next to Network Interface, dc01222 is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image59.png "Network Interface")

11. Select the **IP** **configurations**

    ![Under Settings, IP configurations is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image60.png "Settings section")

12. Click the IP Configuration named **ipconfig1**

    ![In the IP Configuration blade, under Name, ipconfig1 is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image61.png "IP Configuration blade")

13. On the **ipconfig1** blade, change the **Private IP address settings** to **Static.** Leave all the other settings at their defaults and click the **Save** icon.

14. Once Azure notifies the network interface change is saved, repeat these steps on the remaining 3 DCs (**DC02**, **DC03**, and **DC04**)

    > **Note**: Static IP for DC02 should be 10.0.2.6. DC03 should be 172.16.2.4 and DC04 should be 172.16.2.5.

15. In the Azure portal, click **More Services \>** and in the filter, type in **Virtual Networks**. Select **VNET2** from the list.

16. In the **Settings** area, select **DNS Servers**

    ![Under Settings, DNS servers is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image63.png "Settings section")

17. Change **DNS servers** to **Custom**, and provide the address of **10.0.2.4** in the **Primary DNS server** box. Click the **Save** icon to commit the changes.

    ![In the DNS Servers blade, under DNS servers, the Custom radio button is selected, and the field below it is set to 10.0.2.4. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image64.png "DNS Servers blade")

18. At this point, restart **DC03** and **DC04**, so they can get their new DNS Settings

    > **Note**: DC01 and DC02 received the correct DNS settings from the VNET DNS configured prior to their deployment, as the Customer DNS was set before the hands-on lab for that VNET. DC03 and DC04 must be rebooted to receive the updated DNS settings from their virtual network.

19. While these two DCs are rebooting, RDP into **ADVM**, and run the following PowerShell command:

    ```
    Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name contoso.com -DynamicUpdate NonsecureAndSecure 
    ```

    > **Note**: This would not be done in a production environment, but for purposes of our hands-on lab, we need to perform this step for the SQL Cluster in the coming tasks.

20. After the PowerShell command runs, Sign Out of **ADDC**

### Task 5: Promote DCs as additional domain controllers 

1.  Login to **LABVM** created before the hands-on lab or the machine where you have downloaded the exercise files

2.  Browse to the Azure portal and authenticate at <https://portal.azure.com/>

3.  Click on **DC01** on the Azure dashboard

4.  In the **Settings** area, click **Extensions**

    ![Under Settings, Extensions is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image65.png "Settings section")

5.  Click the **+ Add** icon

    ![Screenshot of the Add icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image66.png "Add icon")

6.  Choose **Custom Script Extension** by Microsoft Corp., and click the **Create** button to continue

    ![The Custom Script Extention option displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image67.png "Custom Script Extention option")

    ![The Script file field is set to AddDC.ps1, and the OK button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image68.png "Script section")

8.  This script will run the commands to add this DC to the domain as an additional DC in the contoso.com domain. Repeat these steps for **DC02**, **DC03**, and **DC04**.

9.  Once this succeeds, you will see a **Provisioning succeeded** message under **Extensions** for all four domain controllers

    ![In the Extensions blade, the status for CustomScriptExtensions is Provisioning succeeded.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image69.png "Extensions blade")

    > **Note**: While this a live production environment, there would need to be some additional steps to clean up Region 1 and to configure DNS, Sites and Services, Subnets, etc. Please refer to documentation on running Active Directory Virtualized or in Azure for details. ADDC should be demoted gracefully, and if required, a new DC can be added to the ADAVSet and data disk attached for F:\\.

10. Open the settings for VNET2 in the Azure portal. Under DNS servers, add the two new domain controller IP addresses and click **Save**

    ![A screen that shows setting the IP addresses for the two new DNS servers on the virtual network.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image70.png "DNS servers")

### Summary

In this exercise, you will deploy Windows Server Active Directory configured for resiliency using Azure Managed Disks and Availability Sets in the primary and the failover region.

## Exercise 3: Build web tier and SQL for resiliency

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy resilient web servers using VM scale sets and a SQL Always-On Cluster for resiliency at the data tier.

### Task 1: Deploy SQL Always-On Cluster 

In this task, you will deploy a SQL Always-On cluster using an ARM template that deploys to your existing Virtual Network and Active Directory infrastructure.

1.  Navigate to <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-building-resilient-iaas-architecture-sql> and click the **Deploy to Azure Button**

    ![The Deploy to Azure button is highlighted for deploying a sample from GitHub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image71.png "Sample page")

2.  Specify the resource group name as **CloudShopRG** and ensure the region is set to **West Central US**

    ![The custom deployment blade is displayed with CloudShopRG as the resource group and West Cental US as the location.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image72.png "Custom deployment")

3.  Check the two checkboxes for agreeing to terms and conditions and Pin to Dashboard and click Purchase to start the deployment

    ![A screen with the checkboxes for I agree to the terms and conditions and Pin to dashboard checked and the purchase button highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image73.png "Terms and Conditions")

4.  Wait until the template deployment is complete before continuing

5.  Open a remote desktop connection to the **SQLVM-1** virtual machine you created in the previous task, and login using the **contoso\\demouser** account with the password demo@pass123

    ![Screenshot of the Connect icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image52.png "Connect icon")

6.  Once connected, open the Windows Explorer, check to make sure the F:\\ Drive is present, and the Database was restored to the F:\\Data directory

7.  Next, run this command from **SQLVM-1** to create a Cluster for the SQL Always-On Group. **Start \> PowerShell \> Enter**, and execute the following commands:

```
    New-Cluster -Name CLUST-1 -Node SQLVM-1,SQLVM-2,WITNESSVM -StaticAddress 10.0.1.8 
```

8.  This will create a three-node cluster with a static IP address. It is also possible to use a wizard for this task, but the resulting cluster will require additional configuration to set the static IP address to be viable in Azure. This is due to the way Azure DHCP distributes IP addresses causing the cluster to receive the same IP address as the node it is executing on resulting in a duplicate IP address and failure of the cluster service.

    ![In the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window, PowerShell commands display. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image75.png "Administrator: Windows PowerShell window")

9.  Once the PowerShell command has completed, open the **Failover Cluster Manager**, expand the **CLUS-1** cluster, select Nodes, validate all nodes are online and Assigned Vote and Current Vote are listed as "1" for all nodes of the cluster

    ![In Failover Cluster Manager, in the Nodes pane, three Nodes display: SQLVM-1, SQLVM-2, and Witness VM. Their Assigned Votes and Current votes are all 1.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image76.png "Failover Cluster Manager")

10. Launch **SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager** on **SQLVM-1**

    ![SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager is typed in the search field, and below, SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image77.png "Search field and results")

33. After successfully connecting to the AOG listener, disconnect from both SQLVM-1 and SQLVM-2 by using Sign Out from the RDP windows

### Task 2: Convert the SQL deployment to Managed Disks 

In this task, you will convert the disks of the SQL deployment to managed disks. This task could be automated as part of the template deployment; however, it is important to understand how to migrate existing infrastructure to managed disks.

1.  On LABVM open the PowerShell ISE Tool

**Note**: In the next few steps, you will use PowerShell to migrate the disks for the SQL Unfractured to Managed Disks.

2.  In the execution pane, login to Azure using the Login-AzureRmAccount, and press Enter

    Login-AzureRmAccount

3.  At the Azure login screen, enter your Account and Password

    ![The Microsoft Azure login screen displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image98.png "Azure login screen")

4.  Once logged in, make sure to set your subscription that is the default for this hands-on lab

    ```
    Get-AzureRMSubscription
    Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName ???your subscription name???
    ```

5.  Once this is completed, run the following command to verify your VMs for the hands-on lab are present.

    ```
    Get-AzureRMVM -ResourceGroupName contosoCloudShopRG

    ```
    
6.  Now, move to the scripting pane of the PowerShell ISE tool. Paste this code into the window.

    ```
    <#
        The following code converts the existing availability to aligned/managed and then converts the disks to managed as well. 
        Note: The PlatformFaultDomainCount is set to 2 - this is because the region currently only supports two managed fault domains
    #>

    $rgName = 'contosoCloudShopRG'

    $avSetName = 'SQLAVSet'

    $avSet = Get-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $avSetName

    $avSet.PlatformFaultDomainCount = 2

    Update-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned

    foreach($vmInfo in $avSet.VirtualMachinesReferences)
    {
        $vm = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $vmInfo.id}

        Stop-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vm.Name -Force

        ConvertTo-AzureRmVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name
    }
    ```

7.  Next, click the **Play** button in PowerShell\_ISE. This will deallocate all the machines in the Availability Set SQLAVSET and migrate them to a Managed AVSET and the disk to Managed Disks.

    > **Note**: This process will take about 10-15 minutes to complete and be careful not to stop the process.

8.  Open the Azure portal and browse to the **CloudShopRG** Resource Group. Notice now, the machines are using Managed Disks, and the disk objects now appear.

    ![Four Disk objects display: SQLVM-1, SQLVM-1\_SQL1datadisk1, SQLVM-1\_SQL1datadisk2, and SQLVM-1\_SQLVM-1OSDisk.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image99.png "Disk objects")

### Task 3: Build a scalable and resilient web tier

In this task, you will deploy a VM scale set that can automatically scale up or down based on the CPU criteria. The application the scale set deploys points to the new SQL AlwaysOn availability group created previously.

1.  Navigate to <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-building-resilient-iaas-architecture-ss> and click the **Deploy to Azure Button**

    ![The Deploy to Azure button is highlighted for deploying a sample from GitHub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image100.png "Sample screen")

2.  Specify the existing resource group **CloudShopRG** and set the **Instance Count to 2**

    > **Note**: The instance count is the initial number of servers deployed. The number can change based on the auto scale rules set in the ARM template.

3.  Agree to the terms, check **Pin to dashboard** and click **Purchase**

4.  While the scale set is deploying, open the ARM template you just deployed by navigating to: <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-building-resilient-iaas-architecture-ss/blob/master/azure-deploy.json>. Review the auto scale settings in the autoscalewad resource to understand how the default auto scale settings are configured.

### Summary

In this exercise, you deployed resilient web servers behind a load balancer, and a SQL Always-On Availability Group for database resiliency.

## Exercise 4: Configure SQL Server Managed Backup 

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure SQL Server Managed Backup to back up to an Azure Storage Account.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Storage Account

In this task, you will add a 3rd node to the SQL Always-On deployment in a second region that you can then failover with Azure Site Recovery in the event of a failure in the primary region.

1.  From the lab virtual machine, execute the following PowerShell ISE commands to create a new storage account and generate the tSQL needed to configure managed backup for the AdventureWorks database

    ```
    $storageAcctName = "[unique storage account name]"

    $resourceGroupName = "contosoCloudShopRG"
    $containerName= "backups"
    $location = "West Central US"
    $storageSkuName = "Standard_LRS"


    "Creating Storage Account $storageAcctName"
    $sa = New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName  `
                                    -Name $storageAcctName `
                                    -Location $location `
                                    -SkuName $storageSkuName 


    $storageKey = (Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -Name $storageAcctName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName )[0].Value
    $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAcctName -StorageAccountKey $storageKey


    Write-Host "Creating New Storage Container  $containerName" 
    New-AzureStorageContainer -name $containerName -permission container -context $context


    $fullSasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name $containerName -Permission rwdl -FullUri -Context $context  
    $containerUrl = $fullSasToken.Substring(0,$fullSasToken.IndexOf("?"))
    $sasToken = $fullSasToken.Substring($fullSasToken.IndexOf("?")+1)


    $enableManagedBackupScript = @"
    --------------------
    ---BEGIN TSQL Script
    --------------------
    CREATE CREDENTIAL [$containerUrl] 
    WITH IDENTITY = 'Shared Access Signature', 
         SECRET = '$sasToken' 

    GO

    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_config_basic   
     @enable_backup = 1,   
     @database_name = 'AdventureWorks',  
     @container_url = '$containerUrl',   
     @retention_days = 30
       
     --------------------
     ---END TSQL Script
     --------------------
    "@


    write-host $enableManagedBackupScript 
    ```

2.  Execute the code using PowerShell ISE. Make sure you change the **\$storageAcctName = \"\[unique storage account name\]\"** field to a unique storage account name across Azure prior to execution. Make sure you save the code generated between the **Begin TSQL Script and End TSQL Script** in your PowerShell ISE output after execution into a notepad file. This code creates an identity using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) to a container in the storage account and configures managed backup when executed.

### Task 2: Configure managed backup in SQL Server

1.  Connect to **SQLVM-1** using remote desktop and launch SQL Server Management Studio

2.  Right click on **SQLVM-1**, and click **New Query**

    ![A screen showing how to launch the new query pane in SQL Server Management Studio.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image102.png "Launching the new query pane")

3.  Paste in the following code and click **Execute** to enable SQL Server Agent extended stored procedures. Refresh SQL Server Management Studio and if SQL Server Agent is stopped right click on it and click Start.

    ```
    EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    EXEC sp_configure 'Agent XPs', 1
    GO
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    ```

4.  Paste the code copied to notepad (the code that creates the new SQL identity with a Shared Access Signature) in the previous task into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute**

5.  Paste the code into the query window replacing the existing code and click **Execute** to create a custom backup schedule

    ```
    USE msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC managed_backup.sp_backup_config_schedule   
         @database_name =  'AdventureWorks'  
        ,@scheduling_option = 'Custom'  
        ,@full_backup_freq_type = 'Weekly'  
        ,@days_of_week = 'Monday'  
        ,@backup_begin_time =  '17:30'  
        ,@backup_duration = '02:00'  
        ,@log_backup_freq = '00:05'  
    GO  
    ```
6.  Execute the following tSQL in the query window to generate a backup on-demand. You can also specify Log for \@type

    ```
    EXEC msdb.managed_backup.sp_backup_on_demand   
    @database_name  = 'AdventureWorks',
    @type ='Database' 
    ```
    
## Exercise 5: Validate resiliency

### Task 1: Validate resiliency for the CloudShop application 

1.  In the Azure portal, open the **CloudShopRG** resource group. Click the VM scale set created in the previous task.

2.  Click the Scaling menu item to review the auto scale settings that were deployed with the ARM template

    ![The scaling menu item under settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image103.png "Scaling")

    ![The screen depicts the auto scale rules deployed by the ARM template.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image104.png "Auto scale settings")

3.  Click the **Overview** tab and copy the public IP address to the clipboard, and navigate to it in a different browser tab

4.  After the application is loaded, click the Spike CPU button to simulate an auto scale event

    ![A screen that shows the web page that allows for spiking the CPU,.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image105.png "CPU Spike Demo")

5.  After 15-20 minutes, click the instances button to validate that additional instances were added in response to the CPU spike

    ![The instances icon under settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image106.png "Instances")

    You will see something like the following after a while with new instances starting.

    ![Multiple instances running and in the creating state for the VM scale set.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image107.png "Instance status")

### Task 2: Validate SQL Always On

1.  Within the Azure portal, click on Virtual Machines and open **SQLVM-1.** Click **Stop** at the top of the blade to shut the virtual machine off.

2.  After the VM is deallocated, refresh the CloudShop application in your browser. If the page loads with data in the dropdown list SQL has successfully failed over the primary node to the secondary. You can login to the secondary vm (SQLVM-2) and connect via SQL Server Management Studio to confirm.

### Task 3: Validate backups are taken 

1.  In the Azure portal, click All Services and search for Recovery Vault. Click the link and you should see the two recovery vaults created as part of the deployment of the Active Directory domain controllers.

2.  Open each vault and validate that a backup of the VM has occurred

    ![The screen shows 2 backup items from one of the vaults.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image109.png "Usage")

3.  To validate the SQL Server backup, open the Storage Account created earlier in the Azure portal and click **Blobs** -\> and then **backups**. If the backup has already completed, you will see the backup file in the container.

    ![An image that depicts SQL Server backup data in an Azure Storage Account.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-BuildingaresilientIaaSarchitectureimages/media/image110.png "Backup files in storage")

## After the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Delete the resource groups created

1.  Within the Azure portal, click Resource Groups on the left navigation

2.  Delete each of the resource groups created in this lab by clicking them followed by clicking the Delete Resource Group button. You will need to confirm the name of the resource group to delete.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
