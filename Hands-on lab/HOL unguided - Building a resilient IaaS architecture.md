# Building a resilient IaaS architecture hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a pre-configured IaaS environment and then redesign and update it to account for resiliency and in general high availability. Throughout the hands-on lab you will use various configuration options and services to help build a resilient architecture. 

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and use the following services:


-   The use of availability sets

-   The use of Managed Disks

-   Design principles when provisioning storage to VMs

-   Effective employment of Azure Backup to provide point-in-time recovery

-   SQL Server Always On Availability Groups 

## Overview

Contoso has asked you to deploy their infrastructure in a resilient manner to insure their infrastructure will be available for their users and gain an SLA from Microsoft.

#### Exit criteria

-   The DCs should be configured for resiliency in availability sets and with managed disks

-   The DCs should also be configured for Azure Backup

### Task 3: Add data disks to Active Directory domain controllers (both regions)

#### Tasks to complete

-   Add an additional data disk (managed) to each of the domain controllers

#### Exit criteria

-   Each DC should have an additional SSD based 1023 GB managed disk attached

### Task 4: Format data disks on DCs and configure DNS settings across connection

#### Tasks to complete

-   Format the disks as the F: drive on each of the VMs

-   Configure the virtual networks in each region to reference the IPs of the new Domain Controllers

-   Run the following script on the ADVM virtual machine:

-   Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name contoso.ins -DynamicUpdate NonsecureAndSecure 

#### Exit criteria

-   Each DC should have an additional SSD based 1023 GB managed disk attached and formatted

-   The Virtual Networks in each region should reference the local DCs in each region

-   The Set-DnsServerPrimary zone cmdlet should be executed on ADVM

### Task 5: Promote DCs as additional domain controllers 

#### Tasks to complete

-   Promote the four DCs to join the contoso.ins Active Directory domain

#### Exit criteria

-   All the DCs should be Domain Controllers

### Summary

In this exercise, you will deploy Windows Server Active Directory configured for resiliency using Azure Managed Disks and Availability Sets in the primary and the failover region.

## Exercise 3: Build web tier and SQL for resiliency

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy resilient web servers using VM scale sets and a SQL Always-On Cluster for resiliency at the data tier.

### Task 1: Deploy SQL Always-On Cluster 

In this task, you will deploy a SQL Always-On cluster using an ARM template that deploys to your existing Virtual Network and Active Directory infrastructure.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Navigate to <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-building-resilient-iaas-architecture-sql> and click the **Deploy to Azure Button**. Deploy the template to the ContosoCloudShopRG resource group in the West Central US region.

-   After the template is deployed, execute the following command on SQLVM-1:
    ```
    New-Cluster -Name CLUST-1 -Node SQLVM-1,SQLVM-2,WITNESSVM -StaticAddress 10.22.1.8 
    ```

-   Enable SQL Server AlwaysOn on SQLVM-1 and SQL VM-2 and change the service login for both to Contoso\\adadmin

-   Copy the script from: **C:\\HOL\\CreateSQLAG.sql** on the LABVM to **C:\\SQATA on SQLVM-1**. Execute the script in cmd mode.

#### Exit criteria

-   SQL AlwaysOn Availability groups should be deployed

### Task 2: Convert the SQL deployment to Managed Disks 

In this task, you will convert the disks of the SQL deployment to managed disks. This task could be automated as part of the template deployment; however, it is important to understand how to migrate existing infrastructure to managed disks.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Execute the following script to convert the SQL disks to managed
```
    <#
    The following code converts the existing availability to aligned/managed and then converts the disks to managed as well. 
    
    Note: the PlatformFaultDomainCount is set to 2 - this is because the region currently only supports two managed fault domains
    #>

    $rgName = 'ContosoCloudShopRG'

    $avSetName = 'SQLAVSet'

    $avSet = Get-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -ResourceGroupName \$rgName -Name \$avSetName

    $avSet.PlatformFaultDomainCount = 2

    Update-AzureRmAvailabilitySet -AvailabilitySet $avSet -Sku Aligned

    foreach($vmInfo in $avSet.VirtualMachinesReferences)

    {
        $vm = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $vmInfo.id}

        Stop-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Name $vm.Name -Force

        ConvertTo-AzureRmVMManagedDisk -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VMName $vm.Name
    }
```

#### Exit criteria

-   All the disks for the SQL deployment should be managed

### Task 3: Build a scalable and resilient web tier

In this task, you will deploy a VM scale set that can automatically scale up or down based on the CPU criteria. The application the scale set deploys points to the new SQL AlwaysOn availability group created previously.

#### Tasks to complete

-   Navigate to <https://github.com/opsgility/cw-building-resilient-iaas-architecture-ss> and click the **Deploy to Azure Button**. Deploy the template to the ContosoCloudShopRG resource group in the West Central US region.

#### Exit criteria

-   The scale set should be deployed, and you should be able to browse the CloudShop application from the public IP address assigned to the load balancer

### Summary

In this exercise, you deployed resilient web servers behind a load balancer, and a SQL Always-On Availability Group for database resiliency.

## Exercise 4: Configure SQL Server Managed Backup 

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure SQL Server Managed Backup to back up to an Azure Storage Account.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Storage Account

#### Tasks to complete

-   Create a storage account for SQL server backup data by executing the following PowerShell script on your LABVM
    ```
